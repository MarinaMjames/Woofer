## Project Description: 
Are you looking for a new furry friend. Input your zip code, dog size, dog age and gender to get back a list of dogs in your area. Easily find dogs that are local to you! 

## Motivation: 
Petfinder is not the most user friendly website, normally you would need to use google maps in addition to petfinder in order to find out how far away an adoptable dog is. Woofer solves this issue by displaying near by dogs right onto a google map. 

## End Result: 
We used the [`Petfinder API`](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs) and [`Google Maps API`](https://developers.google.com/maps/) in order to create a google map with markers generated using the input values and petfinders data. This allows users to find locaation of available dogs relevant to their own location in a much easier and expedited way.

## Challenges: 
Our main challenge was incorporating a messaging API into our application, but unfortunately we were unable to find any good alternatives and we had to slightly change our plans. As a team we collectively made the decision to change our plans and use the pefinder API instead to change this into a website to help adopt animals that need homes.

## Future Improvements: 
In future we would like to integrate a phone calling API so that users can directly call the shelters using their website browser. We would also like to make the modals pop up during mouse over of a marker on the google map.
